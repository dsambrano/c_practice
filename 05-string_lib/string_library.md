# String Library

As you saw in the Arrays section, strings are a bit weird and worse yet cumbersome.
Luckily there are standard libraries to deal with strings.

`#include <string.h>`

There are a lot of useful options.
For this one, just check out the code, I made a ton of comments to help explain what is happening, and I don't think it would be helpful repeating it here.
