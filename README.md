Getting Basic Practice with C.

## Plan

In case, anyone wants to follow the way I did.
I first went through the [W3][] C tutorial and then made my first script and makefile with the help of the [raspberrypi-stackoverflow][].
Finally, I learned a little bit more of the basics plus how to use GUIs with this [book][]
